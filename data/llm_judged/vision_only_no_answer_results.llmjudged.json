    "answer": "The GroundSent-Both model performs best on the SNLI dataset, achieving an accuracy of 72.0%. Grounding contributes to an improvement of 4.7% compared to the baseline STb-1024 model, which achieves 67.3%.",
    "caption": "Table 3: Thorough investigation of the contribution of grounding, ensuring equal number of components and identical architectures, on the variety of sentence-level semantic benchmark tasks. STb=SkipThought-like model with bidirectional LSTM+max. 2×STb-1024=ensemble of 2 different STb models with different initializations. GroundSent is STb-1024+Cap2Cap/Img/Both. We find that performance improvements are sometimes due to having more parameters, but in most cases due to grounding.",

Since STb‑1024 scores 67.3 on SNLI, grounding in GroundSent‑Both improves performance by 4.7 points, rather than reducing it. Always scan the SNLI column carefully and compare each value to identify the maximum before drawing conclusions."
