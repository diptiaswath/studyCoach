Feedback B incorrectly credits the student for identifying that 'the low-resolution input provides identity information,' which is actually wrong per Feedback A. Feedback B's main correction is only about the omission of the high-res identity image's role, missing the core misconception that the student misattributed identity to the low-res input.

STb=SkipThought-like model with bidirectional LSTM+max. 2×STb-1024=ensemble of 2 different STb models with different initializations. GroundSent is STb-1024+Cap2Cap/Img/Both. We find that performance improvements are sometimes due to having more parameters, but in most cases due to grounding.",
