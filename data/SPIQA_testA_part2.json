This suggests that the first reattention is more effective in capturing word pair similarities using the original word representations. In contrast, the later reattention might be negatively impacted by the highly non-linear word representations generated in the previous layers.",

The diameter is a measure of how far apart nodes are in the graph, and a lower diameter indicates a better manifold recovery.

According to the passage, the exclusive KL divergence term encourages the inference distribution to be more accurate, while the pixel prediction loss further improves video quality during inference. Therefore, the absence of these terms in the \"SDVI loss term 1&3\" model likely explains its inferior performance compared to the full SDVI model.",

This observation suggests that the additional loss terms in the full model contribute to improved reconstruction quality and video quality during inference. The passage provides the theoretical justification for including these additional terms, specifically highlighting their roles in promoting accuracy and diversity in the inference distribution and enhancing video quality.

        "answer": "The Entropy Balancing (EB) estimator performs best across all measures (Bias, MAE, and MSE) when confounders are noisy. While the CC estimator also performs well, it exhibits slightly higher bias and MAE compared to EB.",
        "explanation": "The table presents the performance of different ATETR estimators under the condition of noisy confounders. The performance is evaluated based on three metrics: Bias, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE). By comparing the values in the table, we can see that EB has the lowest values for all three metrics, indicating its superior performance. Although CC also shows good performance, its metrics are slightly higher than those of EB, suggesting a slightly lower accuracy in this scenario.",

The EB and CC estimators have boxplots that are centered close to the true ATETR value of 0, indicating that they have small biases. Additionally, the passage states that the EB and CC estimators have the best MSE performance across all estimators.",
