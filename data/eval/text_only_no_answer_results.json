When the SMT average rank is below 3, the CCA average rank is also lower (1.64 vs. 1.77).\n2. When the SMT average rank is 3 or higher, the CCA average rank is significantly higher (3.54 vs. 3.46).\n\nThis suggests that CCA might perform relatively better for low-quality captions, but more data and analysis are needed for a conclusive answer.",
