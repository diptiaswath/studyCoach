Masks tightly encompass the specific region referred to by the phrase, whereas bounding boxes can include extraneous areas. \n\nThis relates to the difference in performance between Visual Genome and Flickr30k because both Visual Genome and ReferIt (mask) contain phrases that refer to very specific regions or non-salient objects. Precise localization is crucial for achieving high accuracy on these datasets. Flickr30k, on the other hand, annotates all bounding boxes referring to a phrase, leading to potentially less precise localization requirements and generally higher performance across methods.",
